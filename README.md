# Prework Study Guide

## Description

This prework study guide was created to assist me, a student in a coding bootcamp, in containing everything I have learned into one easy application. This application makes looking at all of my prework notes much easier. I leanred while making this study guide a lot of the basics of coding and have already gained some skills in being able to use VS Code and GitHub effectively.
