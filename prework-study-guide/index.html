        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
           <li>Element is the type of content on a webpage or also used to divide content on a page and describe that content to browsers and other developers. </li>
           <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
           <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
           <li>Elements are composed of opening < and closing > tag.</li>
           <li>Declaration tells the browser the document type to expect when opened.</li>
           <li>Declarations are not case sensitive, HTML elements are case sensitive</li>
           <li>HTML attribute defines additional information about an element.</li>
           <li>Metadata is data about our webpage that the browser uses to effectively serve our webpage to users which is not typically seen by the users.</li>
           <li>Semantic HTML elements is when the name of the element describes its content and the rold it plays on the webpage. It makes it easier to read by other developers and the browser and has an important role in making sure the webpage is accessible to all users.</li>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS styles an element directly in an HTML file, applies to a specific HTML tag and is a quick and permanent change.</li>
          <li>Internal style sheet embeds an entire style sheet diectly in the HTML file using style elementsin the head element. The rules will only apply to that page and a single change to the CSS rule will apply to all tagged page elements.</li>
          <li>External style sheet is the most commonly used. It allows developers to keep all CSS rules in a seperate file and make design changes easier. You will link the file using link element placed in HTML's head element.</li>
          <li>Class attribute will share CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to class attribute with class selector. It can then be assigned to an element in HTML, enabling us to choose which elements will be assigned in CSS rule.</li>
        </ul>

          <li>An index is a unique number to identify the location of the data item in an array, always starting with 0.</li>

          <li>A function is a powerful core component of many programming languages and is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
